### Git Introduction

Git is usually used with a remote source which is hosted on GitHub, Azure DevOps or other products that support Git. But, it can be also used locally.

Initialize a folder to become a git repository is as easy as that:

```text
git init
```

To commit a change in the git repository, either use the source control activity bar or the command line:

```text
git add .
git commit -m "Updated readme"
```

> Note: The only requirement for that is to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally.
