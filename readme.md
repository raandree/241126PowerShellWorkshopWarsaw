### 1.2.1. Git Introduction

Git is usually used with a remote source which is hosted on GitHub, Azure DevOps or other products that support Git. But, it can be also used locally.

Initialize a folder to become a git repository is as easy as that:

```text
git init
```

To commit a change in the git repository, either use the source control activity bar or the command line:

```text
git add .
git commit -m "Updated readme"
```

> Note: The only requirement for that is to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally.

To create a new branch, merge the new branch to master and delete it afterwards it is comfortable to use the UI. The commands the UI sends to the git.exe are these ones:

```text
git checkout -b fix/bug2
```

Then do some change in the new branch and the continue the sequence:

```text
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed bug 2"

git checkout master

git merge fix/bug2
git branch -d fix/bug2
```

To upload / publish the code to GitHub, add a remote repository link like that:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/raandree/241126PowerShellWorkshopWarsaw.git
git push -u origin master
```

#### 1.2.1.1. Markdown

Refer to the [getting started guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

### 1.2.2. Recap

#### 1.2.2.1. Here String

In PowerShell, you can use here-strings to declare blocks of text. Theyâ€™re declared just like regular strings except they have an @ on each end. Instead of being limited to one line, you can declare an entire block or a multiple line string.

```powershell
$text = @"

Hello World $a @"

The name is "Peter"

hello "@
"@
```

#### 1.2.2.2. Native commands return text

As native commands return only text, we have to use regular expressions to extract the data that we are interested in like this:

```powershell
$text = @'
Pinging microsoft.com [2603:1030:b:3::152] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 2603:1030:b:3::152: time=145ms
Reply from 2603:1030:b:3::152: time=142ms
Reply from 2603:1030:b:3::152: time=144ms
Reply from 2603:1030:b:3::152: time=149ms

Ping statistics for 2603:1030:b:3::152:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 142ms, Maximum = 149ms, Average = 145ms
'@

$pattern = 'Reply from [0-9a-f:]+ time=(?<Time>\d{1,4})ms'
$text | Select-String -Pattern $pattern -AllMatches | ForEach-Object {
    $_.Matches.Groups['Time'].Value
}
```

Instead of using a cmdlet rather than the native command, you get an object back and accessing the response time is much easier:

```powershell
$a = Test-Connection -ComputerName microsoft.com
$a.ResponseTime | Measure-Object -Sum -Average -Minimum -Maximum

<#
The output should be like:

Count    : 4
Average  : 144,25
Sum      : 577
Maximum  : 146
Minimum  : 143
Property :
#>
```

#### 1.2.2.3. Error handling

When `ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` is used, you need to make sure the return value of the cmdlet was as expected (`$folder -ne $null`):

```powershell
$folder = Get-Item -Path C:\Window -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if ($folder -ne $null) {
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $folder
    Write-Host "File count: $($files.Count)"
} else {
    Write-Host "Folder not found or inaccessible."
}
```

You want to use `ErrorAction` stop when having a try-catch construct:

```powershell
try
{
    $folder = Get-Item -Path C:\Window -ErrorAction Stop
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $folder
    Write-Host "File count: $($files.Count)"
}
catch
{
    Write-Host "Folder not found or inaccessible."
}
```

#### 1.2.2.4. The difference between singe and double-quoted strings and the format operator

```powershell
$a = 5

"The value of `$a is $a"
'The value of `$a is $a'

$p = Get-Process
$totalWorkingSet = ($p.WS | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum / 1GB
"There are " + $p.Count + " processes running"
"There are $($p.Count) processes running"
'There are {0} processes running' -f $p.Count

'There are {0} processes running which consume {1:N2} GB of memory' -f $p.Count, $totalWorkingSet

#Create a list of 1000 strings with the format "Test 0001", "Test 0002", etc.
1..1000 | ForEach-Object { "Test {0:d4}" -f $_ }
```

#### 1.2.2.5. Reading and Path environment variable

The `PATH` and `PSModulePath` environment variables are used to specify directories for executable files and PowerShell modules, respectively.

```powershell
$env:PSModulePath -split ';'
$env:Path -split ';'
```

#### 1.2.2.6. Format-Table with dynamic / custom columns

This PowerShell script customizes the output of the dir (alias for Get-ChildItem) command to display file sizes in gigabytes.

```powershell
$sizeColumn = @{ 
    Name       = 'Size' 
    Expression = { [Math]::Round($_.Length / 1GB, 2) }
    Width      = 8 
}
dir | Format-Table -Property Length, $sizeColumn, Name
```

#### 1.2.2.7. Out-GridView and the PassThru switch

This PowerShell command sequence allows the user to select one or more running processes from an interactive grid view window and then stops the selected processes.

```powershell
Get-Process | Out-GridView -PassThru
Get-Process | Out-GridView -PassThru | Stop-Process
```

`Out-GridView` does not work remotely. However, you can get the data remotely and show it locally.

```powershell
$sb = {
    Get-Process
}

$result = Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $sb -ComputerName dsccasql01

$result | Out-GridView -PassThru
```

This PowerShell script retrieves the first two running processes from multiple remote computers and displays the selected processes in an interactive grid view window.

Yes, `Invoke-Command` can execute the script block on multiple remote computers in parallel, which can improve performance when querying multiple machines. By default, `Invoke-Command` runs commands in parallel on up to 32 remote computers. You can adjust this limit using the `-ThrottleLimit` parameter if needed.

```powershell
$sb = {
    Get-Process | Select-Object -First 2
}

$computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter *

$result = Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $sb -ComputerName $computers.DnsHostName

$result | Select-Object -Property Name, WS, Handles, PSComputerName | Out-GridView -PassThru
```

This is an extended version of the script with error handling to report on machines that are offline:

```powershell
$sb = {
    Get-Process | Select-Object -First 2
}

$computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter *
$offlineComputers = @()
$allResults = @()

foreach ($computer in $computers) {
    try {
        $result = Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $sb -ComputerName $computer.DnsHostName -ErrorAction Stop
        $allResults += $result
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Failed to connect to $($computer.DnsHostName)"
        $offlineComputers += $computer.DnsHostName
    }
}

if ($allResults.Count -gt 0) {
    $allResults | Select-Object -Property Name, WS, Handles, PSComputerName | Out-GridView -PassThru
}

if ($offlineComputers.Count -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "The following computers were offline or unreachable:"
    $offlineComputers | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ }
}
```
